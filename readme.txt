Program list and preset saving is planned for 1.0 (which comes after 0.1 if no bugfix releases are needed ;) )

* GUI: use config for sensitivity and other stuff?
* GUI: save button (without functionality)
* MacOS .app
* Test in Windows (PC)!!!

== TODO Version 1.0:
* Model: decode & encode missing program data (Expression Pedal?)
* Implement incoming save command
* Expression Pedal
* Poll for device availability and program change!
* Preset list (request from and save to device) edit by using LIVE view
* Save & Load (single) presets to/from file

== TODO Version X:
